=============
There is the game TicTacToe with options:
- field size is any (limited by device screen size only)
- number of signs in winner line is any (limited field size only)

The game has mode: 
- Human vs Human
- Human vs Bot

The Bot has brain mode:
- BrutForce - just weight destructor
- MiniMax - see Wikipedia
- Gardner - see books of Mr. Gardner


There is only authors own code (it's part of the open source Hexlet.org project).
It works independently onto the device quite well.
